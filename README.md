### Data preparation:
Please prepare the PlaqueMS dataset and put it into the static folder in the Django project. Please ensure that all the documents inside have been decompressed, please pay special attention to the _bplot folder. And try to make sure there are no empty folder. I have made some adjustments to the data in the dataset, please paste the Statistics folder from the old dataset Plaque_MS all the way into the PlaqueMS/Carotid_Plaques_Vienna_Cohort folder. Please paste the Networks files in Plaque_MS under the corresponding experiments folder in PlaqueMS.  

You can run 127.0.0.1:8000/format/ to replace all the spaces in the data with underscores, please check all the files in the folder and there are no spaces in the folder before proceeding to the following operation. If this interface is not executed successfully, please click on the file insert_views.py to modify the value of fpath to the path of the current dataset.  

This project requires a dataset for visualization, all relative paths are used in insert_views.py, please follow this path to insert. If you have path problem, please check insert_views.py for more detail about file path.  

Please prepare the protein dataset and put it into the static folder in the Django project. The file should be named HUMAN_9606_idmapping.dat  

you may need to edit the MySql database information in testdj/settings.py. Or you can create a new database named PlaqueMS  

after everything above is done, type python3 manage.py makemigrations in the command line, then type python3 manage.py migrate. Django can automatically generate database table creation scripts and insert them in MySQL.
